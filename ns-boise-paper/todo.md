# TODO list for BOISE revisions

## Introduction - KEEP

- [ ] Modify last

## Methodology - KEEP

- [ ] Add $L_1$ derivation to Supplementary Materials.
- [ ] Better introduction of $L_f$.

## Empirical studies - keep

### FDA data set - keep

- [ ] Hmm... if we selected only a subset of compounds/targets, shouldn't the number be smaller?
I think sentence 2 needs to be pushed further into the paragraph.

#### Retro Analysis - keep

- [ ] Remove discussion of block BOISE.
- [ ] Redo/Rework Fig. 2 w/o block BOISE.
Only 2 plots really needed - ROCAUC/NEF10.
Compare:
    - Baseline
    - fast BOISE
    - $L_0$ 
    - $L_1$

#### Prosp Analysis - keep

- [ ] Remove block BOISE from Table 3.
- [ ] Redo Fig. 3 w/o block BOISE.
- [ ] Rewrite results w/o block BOISE.

### PCBA data set - keep

- [ ] Interestingly, PCBA combines Retro and Prosp analysis into one section. Possible to apply that to FDA?
- [ ] Remove compound clustering discussion.
- [ ] Redo analysis w/o compound CRP? How bad is floating point error?
- [ ] I think we can cut, or at least shorten, the discussion of why fast BOISE did not outperform Random Boise.

## Discussion - KEEP

- [ ] Remove discussion of block BOISE.
