	abstract = {Small-molecule discovery typically involves large-scale screening campaigns, spanning multiple compound collections. However, such activities can be cost- or time-prohibitive, especially when using complex assay systems, limiting the number of compounds tested. Further, low hit rates can make the process inefficient. Sparse coverage of chemical structure or biological activity space can lead to limited success in a primary screen and represents a missed opportunity by virtue of selecting the “wrong” compounds to test. Thus, the choice of screening collections becomes of paramount importance. In this perspective, we discuss the utility of generating “informer sets” for small-molecule discovery, and how this strategy can be leveraged to prioritize probe candidates. While many researchers may assume that informer sets are focused on particular targets (e.g., kinases) or processes (e.g., autophagy), efforts to assemble informer sets based on historical bioactivity or successful human exposure (e.g., repurposing collections) have shown promise as well. Another method for generating informer sets is based on chemical structure, particularly when the compounds have unknown activities and targets. We describe our efforts to screen an informer set representing a collection of 100,000 small molecules synthesized through diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS). This process enables researchers to identify activity early and more extensively screen only a few chemical scaffolds, rather than the entire collection. This elegant and economic outcome is a goal of the informer set approach. Here, we aim not only to shed light on this process, but also to promote the use of informer sets more widely in small-molecule discovery projects.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.},

This problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the "collaborative-filtering" problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations.},
