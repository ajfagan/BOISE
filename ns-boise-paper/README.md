# Changes made to shorten to 25 pages

Considering the data analysis to be a far more interesting result, to shorten the proposed paper, I removed some details of mathematical formulation.

These changes are sufficient to reduce the paper from 31 -> 25 pages (not counting references).

- Removed Discussion of HTS - should be familiar from original paper.
- Removed Discussion of 1st gen IBR's - again, we just want to compare to BOISE, which was compared to these already.
- Shortened discussion of $L_1$ considerably.
  - Removed "state of nature" discussion. 
  - Removed PEL calculation.
- Shortened discussion of $L_2$ considerably.
  - Removed Kendall's $\tau$ statistic
  - Removed weightings
  - Removed alternative formulations $L^p$
  - Removed comparison of $L_i, i=1,2,3$. (???)
- Removed PEL calculation from frequent-hitters
- No change yet in Block BOISE

# Changes mode to shorten to 20 pages

While the data analysis is, in my opinion, far more interesting, there are bits in there that are a bit extraneous. They are the next things to target.

The FDA and PCBA datasets each bring unique insights into the problem context. I'd like to keep both datasets for as long as possible. Therefore, I focus on trimming the analysis conducted in each.

- FDA
  - Retrospective
    - Removed $L_2$'s increasing benefit as $\lim_{x\to100}NEFx$ (???)
    - Removed explanation of Rand Boise outperforming fast BOISE (???)
    -
